    # The buggy implementation would do the following:
    # - Visit 1.  Record 2, 3, and 4 to visit later (since none of them are
    #   `done` yet)
    # - Visit 2, then 3.  Mark 3 as done.
    # - Visit 3 again.  Node 3 is now marked as `done`, but 1 queued it for
    #   later processing before that happened.
