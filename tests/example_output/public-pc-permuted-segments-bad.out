invalid trace: CycleBreak 1 incoming edge Edge(2, 1) is live, but state doesn't match Segment(2)
invalid trace: CycleBreak 2 incoming edge Edge(0, 2) is live, but state doesn't match Segment(0)
invalid trace: CycleBreak 3 incoming edge Edge(1, 3) is live, but state doesn't match Segment(1)
invalid trace: segment 0: cycle 0 sets reg 0 to 99 (expected 2)
invalid trace: segment 0: cycle 1 sets reg 1 to 98 (expected 0)
invalid trace: segment 2: cycle 2 sets reg 2 to 97 (expected 4)
invalid trace: segment 2: cycle 3 sets reg 0 to 96 (expected 10)
invalid trace: segment 1: cycle 4 sets reg 0 to 0 (expected 86)
invalid trace: segment 1: cycle 4 sets reg 1 to 95 (expected 6)
invalid trace: segment 3: cycle 5 sets reg 1 to 6 (expected 95)
invalid trace: segment 3: cycle 5 sets reg 2 to 94 (expected 4)
